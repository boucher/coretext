NAME
    TypefaceJS - Generate fonts for use with typeface.js

SYNOPSIS
    use TypefaceJS;

    my $typeface = TypefaceJS::new->( input_filename => "truetype_font.ttf",
    unicode_range_names => ['Basic Latin', 'Latin-1 Supplement'], );

    $typeface->write_file( output_filename => 'font.typeface.js' );

DESCRIPTION
    TypefaceJS converts truetype fonts to a format that typeface.js can
    read. typeface.js is a javascript library that uses web browsers' vector
    drawing capability (<canvas> and VML) to draw text in HTML documents.
    See http://typeface.neocracy.org.

    Many font vendors specifically prohibit embedding fonts in documents,
    and this module attempts to honor those restrictions.

METHODS
    Methods take named parameters.

    new()
    Takes an "input_filename" which should be a truetype font file, and
    optional arrayref of "unicode_range_names" to support. If no range names
    are specified it is assumed we want all that are supported by the font.
    See Unicode::UCD.

    check_embed_license()
    Checks to see whether the vendor indicated that this font should be
    embedable as indicated by the fsType value in the font's OS/2 table.
    Returns false if any level of restriction is set at all. See page 86 the
    spec: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/tt/ttf_spec/ttch02.doc

    get_unicode_range_counts()
    Returns a hashref containing information about which characters and
    which unicode ranges are supported within this font. See Unicode::UCD.

    get_json_data()
    Returns the JSON data structure used by typeface.js. This contains glyph
    outline information as selected font metadata.

    write_file()
    Writes the font in typeface.js format, using javascript and JSON. Takes
    an optional "output_filename" parameter which defaults to a reasonable
    name if not specified.
